DNA -> Protein ( Translation ) There are 64 codons which code for 20 different amino acids.  Amino Acids join to form a protein sequence. There are 6 reading frames ( 3 forward and 3 reverse) in DNA. All these codes for different protein sequences.

Write a PYTHON program to 

Read the DNA sequence in all the 6 reading frames and print their corresponding protein sequence.

Print the number of start (ATG) and stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) and their positions in all the six reading frames

Translate the DNA sequence from the start codon
