Nested Data Structures:
Write a PYTHON Program to store the gene related information. Each gene has gene_id, gene_symbol, gene_type,gene_name, gene_seq. Given a set of gene details, you should store the above data in an array of arrays, array of hashes, hash of hashes, hash of arrays.

 

Find the gene length and plot top 10 genes and their description using AMCHART.

Note: Refer http://grch37.ensembl.org/info/data/mysql.html  
Also verify your gene length with  https://repl.it/@GaneshManoharan/ReferenceFiles#Gene%20and%20its%20length.txt
